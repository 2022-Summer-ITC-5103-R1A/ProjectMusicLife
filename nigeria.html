            <p><span class="first_letter">D</span>avid Adedeji Adeleke (born 21 November 1992), popularly known as
                Davido, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter and record producer. He blends traditional African elements
                with global mainstream pop.</p>

            <p>
                Davido won the Next Rated award in 2012 at The Headies after releasing "Dami Duro",
                the second single from his debut studio album Omo Baba Olowo(2012). Between 2013 and 2015,
                he released a number of hit singles, and in January 2016, he signed a record deal with Sony Music.
                He then founded the record label Davido Music Worldwide (DMW), to which acts Dremo, Mayorkun, Peruzzi
                and Liya have been signed. In July 2016, Davido signed a record deal with Sony's RCA Records.
                In October 2016, he released the 5-track EP Son of Mercy, which was supported by the singles
                "Gbagbe Oshi", "How Long" and "Coolest Kid in Africa". In April 2017, Davido re-negotiated his contract
                with Sony
                due to creative control issues and later that year he released five singles including "If" and "Fall".
                "If" generated worldwide social media activity while "Fall" became the longest-charting Nigerian pop
                song
                in Billboard history. Davido has been famously referred to as 'The king of modern-day afrobeats'.

                the first single of the multi-song FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Official Soundtrack.

            <p>
                In May 2022, Davido released another song titled "Stand Strong" that featured The Samples Choir.
                According to the Naija banquet, the song is a breakaway from the usual hop/dance style of the Nigerian
                singer. In the record, Davido reminisces on his music journey and the battles he fight everyday. Also,
                it is the story of his healing
